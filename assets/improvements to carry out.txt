# Improvements to Carry Out

Based on the current codebase structure and identified issues, here are the improvements that need to be implemented:

## 1. Risk Amount Implementation in Trade Form

### Current Issue
The trade form collects risk amount from the user but does not properly store or utilize this data in the system. It was being incorrectly added to the Trade object causing TypeScript errors.

### Proposed Solution
Add a dedicated field in the Trade data model to store the actual monetary risk amount for each trade.

### Implementation Logic
1. Modify the Trade interface in [types/index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Wisdom%20Chinyamu/Documents/Code/my-app/src/types/index.ts) to include a `riskAmount` field:
   ```typescript
   export interface Trade {
     // ... existing fields ...
     riskAmount?: number; // Add this new optional field
     // ... existing fields ...
   }
   ```

2. Update the AddTradeForm component to properly map the riskAmount input to the Trade object:
   ```typescript
   // In handleSubmit function
   onSubmit({
     // ... existing mappings ...
     riskAmount: riskAmount ? parseFloat(riskAmount) : undefined,
     // ... existing mappings ...
   });
   ```

3. Utilize this field in profit/loss calculations throughout the app:
   - Update WeeklySummaryPanel to factor in actual monetary values
   - Enhance EquityCurveChart to display actual monetary gains/losses
   - Modify any analytics components to consider riskAmount in calculations

## 2. Trading Accounts Feature

### Current Issue
There is a TradingAccount interface defined but it's not fully integrated with trades. All trades are linked to a user but not to specific accounts.

### Proposed Solution
Implement a complete trading accounts feature that allows users to manage multiple trading accounts, each with their own trade history.

### Implementation Logic
1. Create a new AccountsScreen to manage trading accounts:
   - List all accounts with their current balances
   - Allow adding/deleting accounts
   - Show account statistics (total trades, win rate, etc.)

2. Modify the Trade interface to link trades to specific accounts:
   ```typescript
   export interface Trade {
     // ... existing fields ...
     accountId?: string; // Link to specific trading account
     // ... existing fields ...
   }
   ```

3. Update AddTradeForm to include account selection:
   - Add dropdown to select which account the trade belongs to
   - Default to a primary account if only one exists

4. Update all trade-related screens and components to filter by account:
   - JournalScreen should be able to filter by account
   - Dashboard should show metrics per account or combined
   - Analytics should allow comparison between accounts

## 3. Proper Routine Screen Checklist Implementation. this checklist is separate from the strategy checklists.

### Current Issue
The routine screen has checklist functionality but it appears to be incomplete or not properly connected to the overall system.

### Proposed Solution
Fully implement the routine screen checklist with proper data persistence and integration with the trading system. the user should be able to create a trading rotine that will be like a checklist and the routine activities should be set as critical, important or the other one. 
the user should be able to add more than one routine on the routine page and give each a name and should set when this routine is active. weekdays or weekends and the routines checklist should refresh after the end of the day and for each time the user checks through their routine, there should be a streak shown based on the number of days the user does checks through their routine.
the routines should appear only on the dys they are used like the weekend checklist items reviews should appear on the weekend and the weekday checklist items should appear on the weekends. if the user wants to edit the routine they can edit it from the routine page 

### Implementation Logic
1. Create a proper RoutineScreen with interactive checklist:
   - Daily preparation items
   - Pre-trade mental checklist
   - Post-trade review items
   - Market analysis tasks

2. Connect the checklist to Firebase for persistence:
   - Store completed items with timestamps
   - Track streaks and consistency
   - Allow customization of checklist items

3. Integrate with trading workflow:
   - Require certain checklist items before allowing trade entry
   - Show completion status in dashboard
   - Provide reminders for incomplete routine items

## 4. Strategy Selection and Checklist Integration

### Current Issue
Although there is strategy selection in the AddTradeForm, it seems to not be properly connected to displaying and using the appropriate checklist for the selected strategy.

### Proposed Solution
Ensure that selecting a strategy in the trade form automatically loads and associates the corresponding checklist.

### Implementation Logic
1. Update AddTradeForm to properly handle strategy selection:
   - When a strategy is selected, load its associated checklist
   - Display the checklist items for the user to complete
   - Save selected checklist items with the trade

2. Improve the checklist display in the trade form:
   - Group items by category (Critical, Important, Optional)
   - Show item weights for confluence scoring
   - Implement proper selection mechanism

3. Ensure data flow between components:
   - Strategy selection triggers checklist loading
   - Checklist completion affects confluence score calculation
   - Both strategy and checklist data are saved with the trade

4. Update trade detail view to show:
   - Which strategy was used
   - Which checklist items were completed
   - Confluence score breakdown
